**Charity Fundraising Prediction Model**
**Overview**
Alphabet Soup is a non profit organization which seeks a predictive tool to aid in a selection of applicants most likely to suceed in their endeavors when funded. By employing machine learning and neural networks. The objective is to develop a binary classifier capable of forecasting whether applicants wil achieve sucess with Alphabet Soup's Financial Support. 
#Data Preprocessing
** Dropped Columns **
EIN and NAME columns had to be dropped because they are not targets.
** Target Variable **
IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target variable that needs to be evaluated.
** Feature Variables **
APPLICATION_TYPE 
AFFLIATION

Compiling, training, and Evaluating the Model
The first model was built:
Input Dimensions : 43
Hidden Layers:3 (relu, relu)
Output Layer : 1 (sigmoid)

Accuracy Score: 72.6%
Model Optimization
After conductiong an optimization session, the outcome reaffirmed the selection of the third model although this had the worst outcome out of the three.
** Conclusion **
After examining the three separate model sessions, it is clear that achieving accuracy beyound 72% threshold is challenging. Future steps would involve revisiting the dataset to identify features that might contribute to this observed limitation in predictive accuracy.
